# Discord-Bot
This is a simple experimental discord bot I made in js using the discord.js framework. It can do various tasks such as ban users from a server, lock a server, delete text in specified channels, and send embeds to specified channels by giving various commands. I made this in the event that a discord server is compramised and needs to be shut down temporarily to find the source of the attack. 
** Features
- Ban users
- lock server
- delete text in specific channel
- send embed in specific channel
